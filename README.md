BITeamwork-Translations
=======================

This repository is established as a community-based extension to the popular BITeamwork plug-in for Oracle BI 11g.  It provides the means for users and developers of Oracle BI to contribute correct translations of the BITeamwork software in their native language.  Users can fork the repository, create a push request with a brand new language template by replacing the English values with those in a language which they natively speak. This type of collaboration assists in the global user adoption of BITeamwork and native speaking users.
